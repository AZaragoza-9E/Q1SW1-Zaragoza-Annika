		<h5 style="color:#DEDBD2; text-align :center"> Ë–âºâ€§â‚ŠËš How watercolor helps me in life Ëšâ‚Šâ€§âºË–</h5>
		<b> When I was in around Grade 6 to Grade 9. I really hard a hard time in school. Due to sometimes the too much assesments, social life problems, mental health problems, and etc. Around Grade 6 I normally went for acrylic painting first. But around Grade 7, I discovered my true painting style which was Watercolor Painting. When no one was there to talk to me about things I'm struggling through like my mom, dad, friends and more. Sometimes, I rely to painting to help me keep all those overwhelming feelings inside. Its like alcohol except not harmful for my health at all and is a much more healthy and relaxing coping mechanism. Watercolor has even helped me get attention or recognition from others which was what I wanted since back then, I didn't really feel like that I fit in the school. Watercolor has even helped me make others smile. Like my mother and father when I painted them a special painting for their anniversary. <br>
		<b> Watercolor is a painting style that is way easier compared to acrylic painting (in my opinion). But trust me, watercolor painting will really help you in your life. Or even make a huge change in your life.
